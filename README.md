## About the Book
ArcGIS Enterprise, the next evolution of the ArcGIS Server product line, is a full-featured mapping and analytics platform. It includes a powerful GIS web services server and a dedicated Web GIS infrastructure for organizing and sharing your work. You will learn how to first install ArcGIS Enterprise to then plan, design, and finally publish and consume GIS services. You will install and configure an enterprise geodatabase and learn how administer ArcGIS Server, Portal, and Data Store through user interfaces, the REST API, and Python scripts


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All the code files are present in their respective code folders.

Chapters 01, 03 , 05, and 06 do not have any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
      { 
          "type": "WINDOWS", 
          "properties": { 
            "userPassword": "
                 somestrongpassword", 
             "user": "mydomain\\svc_portal", 
              "isPasswordEncrypted": "false" 
          } 
      } 
```

Mastering ArcGIS Enterprise Administration is written for ArcGIS Enterprise 10.5.1, but version 10.5 can be used as well. You will need access to at least one Windows server with at least Windows Server 2008 as the operating system, access to ArcGIS Enterprise 10.5.1 installation files, and licensing for ArcGIS Enterprise. You will need Microsoft SQL Server 2012 SP3, 2014, or 2016 (Microsoft offers 180-day trial licenses for SQL Server) and ArcGIS Desktop 10.5.1 or ArcGIS Pro. For Python coding, you will need Python 2.7.x that installs with ArcGIS Desktop and Python 3.x that either comes with ArcGIS Pro or can be installed separately. A Python IDE is optional but recommended.
